# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains two `.sql` files:

- `covid-queries.sql`
- `housing-queries.sql`

In the first file, I mainly explored a dataset of COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations.
In the second file, I mainly explored how to clean up a dataset of Nashville Housing data.
The queries in both files were written following a guide set up by Alex The Analyst.

The queries were executed against a local server under MySQL, version 5.4.

## Databases and Tables

The databases constructed for the queries are:

- COVID
- Housing

The COVID database file contains the tables:

- CovidDeaths
- CovidVaccinations

The tables were made from the files `covid-vaccinations.csv` and `covid-deaths.csv`, respectively.

The housing database file contains the table:

- Nashville

The table was made from the file `housing-nashville-data.csv`.
